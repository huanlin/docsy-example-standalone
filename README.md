# Docsy Example - Standalone version

This project is derived from the official [Docsy Example](https://github.com/google/docsy-example) repository, and it can be used as a template as well.

## What is a Standalone version, and why?

*Standalone* means this project does not require additional HTTP connections for pulling dependencies from GitHub. For example, bootstrap, FontAwesome and Docsy. This can be useful in a highly secured private network where HTTP connections to GitHub or GitLab are banned. Despite corporates having their own Nexus server, Docsy still needs to pull some dependencies from GitHub. That was the situation I had struggled with. So I created this Standalone version for myself. 

You might find this project useful if you're struggling with the following errors while running `hugo server` command:

```console
error: unable to access http://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome...
error: unable to access http://github.com/google/docsy...
```

## How to use this project?

First, clone this repo into your local folder, say `d:/work/docsy-example-standalone`. 

Then run `npm install` to see if everything is up-to-date, i.e. no error and nothing needs to download.

```
cd d:/work/docsy-example-standalone
npm install
```

The result should look like this:

```console
up to date, audited 204 packages in 921ms

52 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities
```

Now run `hugo server` command to build and run the website:

```
hugo server
```

You should see something like this:

```console
Start building sites â€¦
hugo v0.115.3-5c2e014a5150553a9fa4f9c1eb7dc4db89c0f1ab+extended windows/amd64 BuildDate=2023-07-13T16:11:34Z VendorInfo=gohugoio

That means success. Your website is now running locally.

> If the first line is `hugo: downloading modules` instead of `Start building sites`, that means something wrong in the configuration files and Hugo is still trying to download dependencies from GitHub, which shouldn't happen.

## How this project is built?

> You don't need to read this section. They are just my notes.

This project is built with the following steps:

1. Copy from the official Docsy Example repository, then clone it into a local directory, e.g. `d:/work/docsy-example-standlone`. Let's call it the work folder.
2. From the work folder, run `'npm install`, remove `node_modules/` from `.gitignore`, then commit and push to GitHub. Without `node_modules` committed to the repo, it won't work in my work environment.
3. Create a `themes` folder under the work folder.
4. Download [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) as a ZIP file, and extract files to `themes/docsy` folder. Git commit and push.
5. Download [bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) as a ZIP file, and extract files to `themes/bootstrap` folder. Git commit and push.
6. Download [FortAwesome/Font-Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) as a ZIP file (Font-Awesome-6.x.zip), and extract files to `themes/font-awesome` folder. Git commit and push. There are about 9,740 files, which is a lot.
 
As you can see, all dependencies are committed to the repo on GitHub.

Now open `hugo.toml` with a text editor, and find the following text:

```toml
  [[module.imports]]
    path = "github.com/google/docsy"
    disable = false
  [[module.imports]]
    path = "github.com/google/docsy/dependencies"
    disable = false
```

Replace them with:

```toml
  [[module.imports]]
    path = "docsy"
    disable = false
  [[module.imports]]
    path = "dependencies"
    disable = false
```

Then open `themes/docsy/config.toml`, and find the following sections:

```toml
[[module.imports]]
  path = "github.com/twbs/bootstrap"
  disable = false
  ignoreConfig = true
[[module.imports]]
  path = "github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome"
  disable = false
```

Replace them with:

```toml
[[module.imports]]
  path = "bootstrap"
  disable = false
  ignoreConfig = true
[[module.imports]]
  path = "font-awesome"
  disable = false
```

That's it.
